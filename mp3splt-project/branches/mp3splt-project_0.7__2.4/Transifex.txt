Our translations are managed using transifex.
To pull these translations into our main svn tree
the transifex command line client is the most comfortable
method,

The documentation of the transifex client can be found here:
http://help.transifex.net/user-guide/client/
Using the client involves at maximum 5 steps:

1) INSTALLATION
sudo easy_install -U transifex-client

2) CONFIGURATION
Get yourself a transifex.net account and then execute:
tx init
The rest of the needed configuration is already part of the
.tx directory.
 
3) PULLING NEW TRANSLATIONS FROM THE SERVER
tx pull -a

4) PUSHING TRANSLATIONS FROM THE .po-FILES TO THE SERVER
tx push -t

5) PUSHING THE CURRENT LIST OF UNTRANSLATED STRINGS TO THE SERVER
This step should not be necessary as long as the server is able
to automatically fetch the source files for our translations from 
our svn server. It it still is - the command to transfer these 
sources manually is:
tx push -s
